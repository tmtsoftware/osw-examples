## OSW Examples
There are three supplemental versions of the tutorial Assembly and HCD called: basic, moderate, and full. The
basic version is similar to the tutorial example here with possible best practices. Two other versions are included that introduce
ways of programming components along with increasing functionality.  The following table shows the
features of each version. Moderate adds functionality to Basic, and Full adds functionality to Moderate.
